# Inter-Engine Communication System

## Overview

The Inter-Engine Communication System provides event-driven communication and data consistency management across all engines in the Fighter Jet SDK. This system ensures that changes in one engine are properly propagated to dependent engines while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **EventBus**: Central message broker for asynchronous event distribution
2. **EngineRegistry**: Registry for managing engine instances and their capabilities
3. **DataConsistencyManager**: Ensures data consistency across engine boundaries
4. **PerformanceMonitor**: Monitors and optimizes cross-engine operation performance
5. **EngineCoordinator**: High-level coordinator that orchestrates all engines

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an event-driven architecture where engines communicate through structured events:

```python
# Example event
event = EngineEvent(
    event_type=EventType.CONFIGURATION_CHANGED,
    source_engine="design",
    target_engines=["materials", "propulsion", "aerodynamics"],
    data={"configuration": updated_config},
    priority=EventPriority.HIGH
)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Event Types

- `CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`: Aircraft configuration updates
- `MODULE_ADDED/REMOVED`: Module changes
- `MATERIAL_UPDATED`: Material property changes
- `ANALYSIS_COMPLETED`: Analysis results available
- `VALIDATION_FAILED`: Validation errors
- `OPTIMIZATION_STARTED/COMPLETED`: Optimization lifecycle
- `SIMULATION_STARTED/COMPLETED`: Simulation lifecycle
- `ERROR_OCCURRED`: Error notifications
- `DATA_INVALIDATED`: Data cache invalidation
- `PERFORMANCE_UPDATED`: Performance metric updates

### 2. Data Consistency Rules

The system enforces data consistency through configurable rules:

```python
rule = DataConsistencyRule(
    rule_id="configuration_consistency",
    source_engine="design",
    dependent_engines=["materials", "propulsion", "aerodynamics"],
    data_fields=["configuration"],
    auto_update=True,
    description="Ensure configuration changes propagate to all engines"
)
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Tracks operation performance and identifies bottlenecks:

- Operation timing statistics
- Event processing performance
- Memory usage monitoring
- Slow operation detection

### 4. Engine Dependencies

Manages dependencies between engines:

```
Design Engine
├── Materials Engine
├── Propulsion Engine
├── Sensors Engine
├── Aerodynamics Engine
└── Manufacturing Engine
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Event Publishing

```python
# Initialize coordinator
coordinator = EngineCoordinator(config)
await coordinator.initialize()

# Process configuration change
result = await coordinator.process_configuration_change(
    new_configuration, source_engine="design"
)
```

### Cross-Engine Analysis

```python
# Run analysis across multiple engines
result = await coordinator.run_cross_engine_analysis(
    "complete_performance", 
    {"analysis_depth": "comprehensive"}
)
```

### Configuration Optimization

```python
# Optimize configuration using multiple engines
result = await coordinator.optimize_configuration({
    "minimize_weight": True,
    "maximize_stealth": True,
    "minimize_cost": False
})
```

## Data Flow

### Configuration Change Flow

1. **Design Engine** updates aircraft configuration
2. **EventBus** publishes `CONFIGURATION_CHANGED` event
3. **Dependent engines** receive and process the event:
   - **Materials Engine**: Updates material analysis
   - **Propulsion Engine**: Recalculates performance
   - **Aerodynamics Engine**: Updates flow analysis
   - **Manufacturing Engine**: Adjusts production planning
4. **DataConsistencyManager** validates consistency
5. **PerformanceMonitor** records operation metrics

### Analysis Coordination Flow

1. **EngineCoordinator** receives analysis request
2. Determines required engines based on analysis type
3. Publishes `ANALYSIS_STARTED` event
4. Engines perform their portion of analysis
5. Results are collected and consolidated
6. `ANALYSIS_COMPLETED` event is published

## Performance Characteristics

    'engines': {
        'design': {'library_path': 'data/modules.json'},
        'materials': {'database_path': 'data/materials.db'},
        'propulsion': {'engine_specs': 'data/engines.yaml'},
        'sensors': {'sensor_configs': 'data/sensors.json'},
        'aerodynamics': {'cfd_settings': 'data/cfd.yaml'},

```python
event_bus_config = {
    'max_workers': 4,
    'max_history_size': 1000,
