When prompted:
- **Username**: `serkove`
- **Password**: Use your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

### Method 2: Using SSH (if SSH key is set up)
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:serkove/PSV-OPAQUE.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
