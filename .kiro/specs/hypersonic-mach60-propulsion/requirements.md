# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for adapting the Advanced Fighter Jet Design SDK to support Mach 60 hypersonic flight capabilities. Mach 60 represents an extreme hypersonic regime (approximately 20,580 m/s at sea level) that requires fundamental changes to propulsion, materials, aerodynamics, and thermal management systems. The adaptation focuses on minimal changes to the existing architecture while enabling this unprecedented speed capability.
