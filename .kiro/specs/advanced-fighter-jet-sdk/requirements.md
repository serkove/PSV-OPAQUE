# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Advanced Fighter Jet Design SDK - a comprehensive software development kit that enables the design, modeling, simulation, prototyping, and manufacturing of an innovative modular fighter jet. The system combines the modular architecture concepts from the SU-75 with advanced capabilities inspired by PSV (Penetrating Strike Vehicle) and Mil-orbs technologies, creating a next-generation aerospace engineering platform that operates entirely through command-line interfaces.

The SDK will support the complete lifecycle of fighter jet development, from initial conceptual design through detailed engineering analysis, simulation validation, and manufacturing preparation. The system emphasizes modularity, advanced materials integration, stealth characteristics, and cutting-edge sensor/effector systems while maintaining practical engineering constraints.
